## 🌠 About me
Your professional — _typical_ — furry scientist/programmer 😅 I get up to a range of techy things both professionally and as a hobby, I love to learn and I am always trying new things.


## 💻 My Stack  

### ✨ Programming ✨  
🖥️ **Editors**:  
💖 `VSCode` (for IDE work) | 🖤 `VIM` (for quick terminal editing)  

🚀 **Languages**:  
🌸 `C`
🌸 `C++`
🌸 `Python`
🌸 `CUDA`  

🔧 **Environment**:  
🐧 `Linux` (`RHEL` | `Ubuntu`) | 🏗️ `mamba` (for environment management)  

💡 I do a lot of high-performance computing work, and that certainly shapes how I tackle my hobby projects!

### 🎀 PCB Design 🎀  
💎 **Software**: `KiCad` (for schematics & PCB layout)  
✨ **Style**: Sleek, modern `SMD` PCB designs
