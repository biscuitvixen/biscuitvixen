## ðŸŒ  About me
Your professional â€” _typical_ â€” furry scientist/programmer ðŸ˜… I get up to a range of techy things both professionally and as a hobby, I love to learn and I am always trying new things.



## ðŸ’» My stack

### Programming
My go-to editors are `VSCode` for IDE work and `VIM` for quick terminal editing ðŸ’…

I prefer to use `C`, `C++`, `Python` and `CUDA`. I do a lot of high-performance compute work and that certainly shapes how I tackle my hobby projects.

I work in `Linux`, either `RHEL` or `Ubuntu` and I manage my environments using `mamba`

### PCB Design
I use `KiCad` for schematics and PCB layout. My preferred style is a sleek, modern `SMD` PCB
